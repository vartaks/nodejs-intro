JavaScript (JS) Engines:
Microsoft Edge - Chakra
Mozilla Firefox - SpiderMonkey
Google Chrome - v8

Browsers provide runtime environment to manipulate DOM (Document Object Model) with functions like document.getElementById('');

In 2009, Ryan Dahl took Google Chrome v8 JS engine and embedded it in C++ program to create Node.exe

Node is a runtime environment to execute JS code outside of any web browser.
This environment does not have objects and functions to manipulate DOM like window and document objects.
But, Node has different functions like fs.readFile() and http.createServer() to work with the file system, network, etc.

Node is NOT a programming language like C#, Ruby or Python.
Node is NOT a framework like ASP.NET, Rails or Django.
It's a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.

Non-blocking and asynchronous nature of Node:
Node handles multiple requests simultaneously using event queue.
Node is ideal for IO-intensive apps.
Node should NOT be used for CPU-intensive apps like video encoding and image manipulation service.

Node has modules like os, fs, path, events and http.

Global node functions:
1. console.log()
2. setTimeout()
3. clearTimeout()
4. setInterval()
5. clearInterval()

Node has global object and module object.

Since Node is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, 
EventEmitter class in events module is one of the core building blocks of Node.
